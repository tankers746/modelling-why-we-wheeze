Installation and MaintenanceInstallation of the project involves unzipping the project files. There are no pre-requisites that need to be installed and all dependencies are included in the project files. The project dependencies include the following libraries and frameworks:•	jQuery v1.10.2•	jQuery UI v1.12.1•	Bootstrap v3.3.7•	D3.js v4.2.6•	noUiSlider v7.0.10•	Tiny Pub/Sub v0.7Changes to these dependencies and their version may result in unexpected results. Each widget is separated into a separate folder. Maintenance can be performed on the the individual js and css files for each widget. However, most maintenance will most likely involve adjusting widget options which are set when the widget is created. For example, the creation of the spinners on the parameter page is done in js/param_script.js. This script initialises all of the widgets on the page and is the place where values such as upper/lower bounds, step, etc are set.
