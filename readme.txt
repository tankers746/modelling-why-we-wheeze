The project "Modeling Why We Wheeze" contains two interactive models which show how the airway of people with asthma are narrowed and how various factors affect the airway muscle.
There are six members in our group who works on different parts of the model (JavaScript, layout, graphing, maths model).
The source directory is called "CITS3200-Project-Group-P". There are three sub-directories inside the folder. 
The "Documentation" folder has the project proposal and analysis.
The "OriginalProject" folder contains the previous established model by NEXT LEARNING. We use it as a reference in our implementation.
The "WebContent" folders contains different parts of the new models. The runnable version of the AHR model is encapsulated in "AHR.html" while the parameter model is in "param.html".
Users can simply click the two pages to use the model.
